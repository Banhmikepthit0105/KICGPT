Related examples: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (trade name, _member_of_domain_usage of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _member_of_domain_usage of trade name? The answer is ". The answer is vinblastine, so the [MASK] is vinblastine. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (vernacular, _member_of_domain_usage of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _member_of_domain_usage of vernacular?

The answer is ". The answer is play hooky, so the [MASK] is play hooky. ".
******
Understood. Here’s what is useful from the examples and facts:

- The pattern is: Given a term (like "trade name", "vernacular", or "disparagement") and the relation "_member_of_domain_usage of", the [MASK] is a specific word or phrase that is an example or instance of that usage domain.
- For "trade name", the answer is a specific trade name (e.g., vinblastine).
- For "vernacular", the answer is a word or phrase used in vernacular speech (e.g., chink, play hooky).
- For "disparagement", the answer is a disparaging term (e.g., nip).

What is useful:
- Understanding the domain (trade name, vernacular, disparagement) helps predict the type of answer.
- The answer is a specific term or phrase that fits the usage domain.
- The relation "_member_of_domain_usage of" links a general category to a specific instance.

This information will help sort candidate answers by their likelihood of being correct. Please provide the candidate answers to be sorted.

- For "trade name", the answer is a specific product or drug name (e.g., magic marker, urex).
- For "colloquialism", the answer is a colloquial word or phrase (e.g., banger).
- For "plural form", the answer is a word in its plural form (e.g., confines).

This means:
- The correct answer should be a specific term that is a member of the domain specified.

******
Understood. The new examples reinforce the following sorting criteria:

- For (trade name, _member_of_domain_usage of, [MASK]), the answer should be a specific trade name, usually of a drug or product (e.g., hemofil).
- For (plural form, _member_of_domain_usage of, [MASK]), the answer can be a word in its plural form (e.g., riding breeches), but sometimes a singular form appears (e.g., authority), suggesting some exceptions or data noise.
- For (archaism, _member_of_domain_usage of, [MASK]), the answer is an archaic word (e.g., fardel).

**Summary of useful information for sorting:**
- The [MASK] should be a specific instance of the domain in the first argument.
- For "trade name", the answer is a specific product or drug name.
- For "plural form", the answer is typically a plural noun, but may occasionally be a singular noun.

The list of candidate answers is [nsaid,benzodiazepine,medicine,antibiotic drug,antiepileptic drug,antiarrhythmic medication,minor tranquillizer,muscle relaxant,beta blocker,trade name]. The question is predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (trade name, _member_of_domain_usage of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _member_of_domain_usage of trade name? The answer is ". Based on these examples and your knowledge, please sort them from most to least likely to be correct. Format: [most possible answer | ... | least possible answer]. Start your response with 'The final order:'
******
The final order:  
nsaid | benzodiazepine | antibiotic drug | antiepileptic drug | antiarrhythmic medication | minor tranquillizer | muscle relaxant | beta blocker | medicine | trade name

**Reasoning:**  
- All examples show that the correct answer is a specific trade name (e.g., periactin, vinblastine, flexeril), not a drug class or general category.
- Among the candidates, "nsaid" and "benzodiazepine" are the closest to specific drug types, but they are still classes, not trade names.
- "Antibiotic drug", "antiepileptic drug", "antiarrhythmic medication", "minor tranquillizer", "muscle relaxant", "beta blocker", and "medicine" are all general categories or classes of drugs, not trade names.
- "Trade name" is the most generic and least likely, as it is the category being asked about, not a member of the category.

**Note:** None of the candidates are actual trade names, but "nsaid" and "benzodiazepine" are more specific than the rest, so they are ranked higher.

Thank you for providing the related examples and supplementary facts. Here’s what might be useful to consider when sorting candidate answers for the question:

1. **Pattern in Examples:**  
   - The tail entity ([MASK]) is not always a geographic region or a direct administrative area.  
   - In the examples, the tail entities are sometimes places (bunker hill, lake trasimenus), but also can be groups or concepts (supporters of islam), or even something less directly related (divvy).

2. **Nature of the Relation:**  
   - The relation "_member_of_domain_region of_" is ambiguous and does not strictly refer to a geographic or political region.  
   - The tail entity can be a location, a group, or an entity associated with the head entity in a non-obvious way.

3. **Contextual Fit:**  
   - The answer should make sense when plugged into the sentence: "what is the _member_of_domain_region of united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland? The answer is [MASK]."
   - The answer does not have to be a country, city, or region; it could be an organization, group, or even a concept.

4. **Consistency with Examples:**  
   - The examples show that the tail entity can be quite varied and not always intuitive.
   - The answer "divvy" for the United Kingdom suggests that the relation is not straightforward and may be based on a specific dataset or knowledge base.

Understood. Here’s a summary of what information is useful for sorting candidate answers for the question:

1. **Nature of the Relation:**  
   - The relation "_member_of_domain_region of_" does not correspond to a standard geographic or administrative relationship.
   - The tail entities in the examples (rock salmon, car boot sale, divvy) are all concepts, objects, or cultural phenomena associated with the United Kingdom, not regions or places.

2. **Pattern in Examples:**  
   - The answers are not geographic regions but rather things, events, or terms culturally or contextually linked to the United Kingdom.
   - For example:  
     - "rock salmon" is a type of food in the UK.
     - "car boot sale" is a British term for a type of market.
     - "divvy" is British slang.

3. **Contrast with Other Relations:**  
   - When the relation is "_has_part of_," the answer is a geographic or political entity (e.g., "scotland").
   - When the relation is "_member_of_domain_region of_," the answer is a culturally or contextually relevant concept.

4. **Sorting Criteria:**  
   - Candidate answers that are British cultural items, slang, foods, or events are more likely to be correct.
   - Answers that are geographic regions or administrative areas are less likely to be correct for this relation.

5. **Consistency:**  
   - The correct answer should fit the pattern of

******
Thank you for the related examples. To sort candidate answers for the question "what is the _member_meronym of suborder blattodea? The answer is [MASK]", here is what is useful to consider:

**Useful Information:**
- The pattern in the examples is that the subject is a higher-level taxonomic group (family, suborder, etc.), and the answer is a member (often a genus or species) within that group.
- "Blattodea" is a suborder of insects commonly known as cockroaches (and, in some classifications, includes termites).
- The _member_meronym relation means "X is a member of Y" (e.g., macrocephalon is a member of megapodiidae).
- The answer should be a genus or species that is a member of the suborder Blattodea.

**What to look for in candidate answers:**
- Names of genera or species of cockroaches or termites.
- Avoid higher-level group names (e.g., "insecta" or "arthropoda") since those are not members but broader groups.
- Avoid unrelated taxa (e.g., plants, mammals).

**Examples of likely answers:**
- Periplaneta (a genus of cockroaches)
- Blattella (another cockroach genus)
- Blatta (another cockroach genus)
- Reticulitermes (a termite genus, if termites are included in Blattodea)

Thank you for the extra facts. Here’s how they inform the sorting of candidate answers:

**Key Insights from Extra Facts:**
- In the context of "suborder blattodea, _member_meronym of, [MASK]", the answer is a taxonomic group that is a member of the suborder Blattodea.
- The provided answers ("family blattidae", "family cryptocercidae") are families within the suborder Blattodea.
- This suggests that the most likely answers are **families** within Blattodea, not genera or species.

**How to Sort Candidate Answers:**
1. **Most Likely:** Names of families within Blattodea (e.g., "family blattidae", "family cryptocercidae", "family blattellidae", "family ectobiidae", "family blaberidae").
2. **Less Likely:** Names of genera or species within Blattodea (e.g., "periplaneta", "blattella")—these are members, but the pattern in the examples favors families.
3. **Unlikely:** Higher-level groups (e.g., "order dictyoptera", "class insecta") or unrelated taxa.

Understood. Here’s how these additional examples further inform the sorting of candidate answers for the question:

**"What is the _member_meronym of suborder blattodea? The answer is [MASK]."**

### Insights from Examples

- The _member_meronym relation can yield answers at different taxonomic levels, but in the context of "suborder", the answer is often a **family** or **order** within that suborder.
    - (tentaculata → order cestida) — order within a class/subclass
    - (magnoliopsida → proteales) — order within a class
    - (suborder blattodea → family blattidae, family cryptocercidae) — family within a suborder
- Sometimes, the answer is a genus or a common name, but when the subject is a higher taxonomic group (like suborder), the answer is usually a **family** or **order**.

### Sorting Criteria

1. **Most Likely:** Families within suborder Blattodea (e.g., family blattidae, family blaberidae, family ectobiidae, family cryptocercidae)
2. **Possible:** Orders within a higher group, but for suborder, families are more likely.
3. **Less Likely:** Genera or species within Blattodea (e.g., periplaneta, blattella)

Given these additional examples, here’s how they further inform the sorting of candidate answers for:

**"What is the _member_meronym of suborder blattodea? The answer is [MASK]."**

### Insights from New Examples

- The _member_meronym relation can yield:
  - A **genus** as a member of a **family** (tricholomataceae → lentinus, mullidae → mullus)
  - A **family** as a member of a **higher group** (salientia → pelobatidae)
  - Occasionally, a **common name** or less standard answer (family corvidae → ladle, though this may be an error or outlier)
- When the subject is a **suborder** (like blattodea), the answer is most often a **family** within that suborder, but sometimes a **genus** within a family of that suborder could also be considered.

### Updated Sorting Criteria

1. **Most Likely:** Families within suborder Blattodea (e.g., family blattidae, family blaberidae, family ectobiidae, family cryptocercidae)
2. **Possible:** Genera within those families (e.g., periplaneta, blattella, blatta, which are genera of cockroaches in Blattodea)

- The pattern is: Given an entity and the relation "_hypernym of", the answer is a more general category (hypernym) of the given entity.
- For example, "garnet" (a specific gem) → "transparent gem" (a more general category of gems).
- "caudate nucleus" (a specific brain structure) → "basal ganglion" (a more general brain structure).
- "physical object" → "physical entity" (a broader category).
- "make" (a verb) → "modify" (a more general verb).

For your question:  
**(rickettsiaceae, _hypernym of, [MASK])**  
"what is the _hypernym of rickettsiaceae? The answer is [MASK]."

**What information is useful?**
- Rickettsiaceae is a family of bacteria.
- The hypernym should be a broader taxonomic group that includes Rickettsiaceae.
- In biological taxonomy, the next broader category above "family" is "order" (e.g., Rickettsiales), or even broader, "class" (e.g., Alphaproteobacteria), or "bacteria" in general.

**To sort candidate answers, useful information includes:**
- Taxonomic hierarchy: family < order < class < phylum < kingdom < domain.
- Rickettsiaceae is a family

Extra facts: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (rickettsiaceae, _member_meronym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _member_meronym of rickettsiaceae? The answer is ". The answer is rickettsia, so the [MASK] is rickettsia. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (rickettsiales, _member_meronym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _member_meronym of rickettsiales? The answer is ". The answer is rickettsiaceae, so the [MASK] is rickettsiaceae. ".
******
Thank you for the extra facts. Here’s what is useful from them:

- The _member_meronym relation is about membership: a member of a group (e.g., rickettsia is a member of rickettsiaceae; rickettsiaceae is a member of rickettsiales).
- This confirms the taxonomic hierarchy: rickettsia (genus) < rickettsiaceae (family) < rickettsiales (order).

**For the _hypernym of rickettsiaceae:**
- The hypernym should be the next broader taxonomic group above "family," which is "order."
- In this case, the order that rickettsiaceae belongs to is "rickettsiales."

**Summary of useful information for sorting candidate answers:**
- The correct answer should be a broader taxonomic group than rickettsiaceae.
- "Rickettsiales" (order) is the direct hypernym of "rickettsiaceae" (family).
- Even broader categories (e.g., "bacteria," "alphaproteobacteria") are possible, but "rickettsiales" is the most precise hypernym.

The answer is ". The answer is exchange, so the [MASK] is exchange. ".
******
Thank you for the additional related examples. Here’s what is useful:

- The hypernym is not always the immediate taxonomic parent, but often a more general category or type.
    - "genus caretta" → "reptile genus" (not the specific family or order, but a general type of genus)
    - "hipsters" → "youth subculture" (a general category)
    - "piece" → "portion" (a general type)
    - "break" → "exchange" (a general type of event/action)

**Implications for (rickettsiaceae, _hypernym of, [MASK]):**
- The answer may not be the specific order "rickettsiales," but rather a general category like "bacterial family" or "family of bacteria."
- The pattern is to generalize the entity to its type or class, not necessarily its direct parent in a hierarchy.

**Summary of what is useful for sorting candidate answers:**
- The most likely answer is a general category that rickettsiaceae belongs to, such as "bacterial family" or "family."
- "Order" (rickettsiales) is less likely, unless the candidate answers are all specific taxonomic groups.
- "Bacteria" or "prokaryote" would be too broad, unless the pattern in the candidate answers is to generalize to a very high level.

This new set of related examples further clarifies the pattern:

- The hypernym is typically a **general type or class** that the entity belongs to, not necessarily the immediate taxonomic parent or the broadest possible category.
    - "jew's-ears" (a specific fungus) → "jelly fungus" (a type/class of fungus)
    - "hydrogen carbonate" (a specific chemical) → "carbonate" (the broader class)
    - "comatoseness" → "unconsciousness" (the broader state)
    - "motorization" → "implementation" (the broader process)

**For (rickettsiaceae, _hypernym of, [MASK]):**
- The answer should be a **general class or type** that rickettsiaceae is an instance of.
- Given the pattern, the most likely answer is **"bacterial family"** or **"family"** (in the context of bacteria), rather than the specific order "rickettsiales" or the very broad "bacteria."

**Summary of useful information for sorting candidate answers:**
- The correct answer is likely a general class or type, such as "bacterial family" or "family."
- Less likely are specific taxonomic parents (like "rickettsiales") or overly broad categories (like "bacteria").
- The pattern is to generalize to the type/class, not the specific parent.

Based on all the related examples provided, the following key patterns emerge for sorting candidate answers:

- The hypernym is typically a **general class, type, or category** that the entity belongs to, not necessarily the immediate taxonomic parent or the broadest possible group.
- Examples show that the answer is often a **noun phrase** describing the kind of thing the entity is (e.g., "antibiotic drug" for "neomycin", "jelly fungus" for "jew's-ears", "bacterial family" for "rickettsiaceae").
- The answer is **not** usually a specific name (like a taxonomic order or genus), but rather a **descriptive category**.

**For (rickettsiaceae, _hypernym of, [MASK]):**
- The most likely answer is a **general category** such as "bacterial family" or "family of bacteria".
- Less likely are specific taxonomic groups (like "rickettsiales") or overly broad categories (like "bacteria").
- The answer should be a **noun phrase** that describes what rickettsiaceae is as a type.

**Summary for sorting candidate answers:**
1. Most likely: "bacterial family", "family of bacteria", "family"
2. Less likely: "rickettsiales" (order), "alphaproteobacteria" (class)
3. Least likely: "bacteria", "prokaryote", or

**For (rickettsiaceae, _hypernym of, [MASK]):**
- The most likely answer is a **general category** such as "bacterial family" or "family of bacteria".
- Slightly less likely, but possible, is the more general "family" (if the context is clear that it refers to biological taxonomy).
- Specific taxonomic names (like "rickettsiales") or very broad categories ("bacteria") are less likely, based on the pattern in the examples.

**Summary for sorting candidate answers by likelihood:**

******
Thank you for the related examples. To sort candidate answers for the question "what is the _hypernym of phylum entoprocta? The answer is [MASK]", the following information is useful:

**1. Understanding "hypernym":**  
A hypernym is a word with a broad meaning that more specific words fall under; a superordinate. In taxonomy, a hypernym of a taxonomic rank is the next higher rank.

**2. Taxonomic hierarchy:**  
- Domain  
- Kingdom  
- Phylum  
- Class  
- Order  
- Family  
- Genus  
- Species  

"Phylum Entoprocta" is a phylum, so its hypernym would be the next higher taxonomic rank, which is "kingdom".

**3. Examples provided:**  
- For "make", the hypernym is "modify" (a more general verb).
- For "physical object", the hypernym is "physical entity" (a more general category).
- For "garnet", the hypernym is "transparent gem" (a more general class).
- For "caudate nucleus", the hypernym is "basal ganglion" (a more general anatomical structure).

**4. Supplementary facts:**  
- Entoprocta is a phylum of mostly sessile aquatic animals.
- The phylum Entoprocta belongs to the kingdom Animalia.

**Therefore, likely candidate answers (sorted by likelihood):**
1. Animalia (kingdom

Extra facts: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (polyzoa, _member_meronym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _member_meronym of polyzoa? The answer is ". The answer is phylum entoprocta, so the [MASK] is phylum entoprocta. ".
******
Thank you for the extra fact. Here’s how it informs the sorting:

- The fact states: "what is the _member_meronym of polyzoa? The answer is phylum entoprocta."  
  This means "polyzoa" is a member of "phylum entoprocta" (i.e., "phylum entoprocta" is a broader category than "polyzoa").

- In your original question, you are looking for the _hypernym of "phylum entoprocta"—that is, the next broader category above "phylum entoprocta".

- From taxonomy, the next broader category above "phylum" is "kingdom", and for "phylum entoprocta", the kingdom is "Animalia".

**Sorted candidate answers by likelihood:**

1. Animalia (kingdom) — most likely, as it is the direct hypernym in biological taxonomy.
2. Kingdom — correct as a type, but less specific than "Animalia".
3. Metazoa — sometimes used synonymously with Animalia, but less standard.
4. Organism — too broad, as it is several levels up.
5. Eukaryote — also broader, as it is above kingdom.

**Summary:**  
The most likely answer to "what is the _hypernym of phylum entoprocta?" is **Animalia**.  
If "Animalia" is not among the candidates, "kingdom" is next most

Thank you for the additional related examples. These reinforce the pattern that the hypernym is a more general category or class immediately above the given entity, often with a descriptive modifier (e.g., "reptile genus" for "genus caretta").

Applying this to your original question:

**Question:**  
What is the _hypernym of phylum entoprocta? The answer is [MASK].

**Reasoning:**  
- "Phylum entoprocta" is a phylum within the animal kingdom.
- The hypernym should be a more general category, likely with a descriptive modifier, just as "reptile genus" is for "genus caretta".
- In taxonomy, the next level up from "phylum" is "kingdom", but the pattern in your examples suggests a phrase like "animal phylum" or "invertebrate phylum" could also be plausible, depending on the context.

**Sorted candidate answers by likelihood:**

1. animal phylum — fits the pattern of a descriptive hypernym, just as "reptile genus" is for "genus caretta".
2. phylum — a general category, but less specific than "animal phylum".
3. invertebrate phylum — plausible, since entoprocts are invertebrates, but more specific than "animal phylum".
4. animal taxon — broader, but still a valid hypernym.
5. kingdom Animalia / Animalia — the next taxonomic

Given all the related examples, the pattern is clear: the hypernym is the immediate, more general category or class that the subject belongs to, often a direct parent in a classification hierarchy.

For "phylum entoprocta", the immediate hypernym should be the broader category that "phylum entoprocta" is a type of. In biological taxonomy, "phylum entoprocta" is a type of "animal phylum" (just as "jelly fungus" is a type of fungus, and "carbonate" is a type of chemical group).

**Sorted candidate answers by likelihood:**

1. **animal phylum** — This fits the pattern of the examples best, as "phylum entoprocta" is a type of animal phylum, just as "jew's-ears" is a type of "jelly fungus".
2. **phylum** — This is a correct hypernym, but less specific than "animal phylum".
3. **invertebrate phylum** — This is accurate, since entoprocts are invertebrates, but is more specific than "animal phylum".
4. **animal taxon** — This is broader, but still a valid hypernym.
5. **kingdom Animalia / Animalia** — This is the next rank up in taxonomy, but is not the immediate hypernym in the sense used in your examples.

**Conclusion:**  
The most likely answer is **animal phylum**.

******
Thank you for providing the related examples. These examples show that the "_has_part of" relation connects a whole to one of its components or constituent parts. For instance:

- writings _has_part of job (a job can be a part of writings, e.g., a written work may include a job description)
- ungulate _has_part of hock-joint (an ungulate has a hock-joint as a body part)
- gestation period _has_part of trimester (a gestation period is divided into trimesters)
- reproduction _has_part of parturition (parturition is a part of the reproduction process)

For the question:  
predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (drill, _has_part of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _has_part of drill? The answer is ".

**Useful information to consider:**
- "Drill" in this context most likely refers to the tool (a device used for making holes), not the animal or a military exercise.
- The answer should be a component or part of a drill (the tool).
- Examples of parts of a drill (tool) include: chuck, bit, motor, handle, trigger, battery (for cordless drills), etc.

******
Thank you for the extra facts. Based on the provided examples and supplementary facts, the most likely answer to the question:

predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (drill, _has_part of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _has_part of drill? The answer is ".

is **bit**.

**Reasoning:**
- The extra fact explicitly states: "The answer is bit, so the [MASK] is bit."
- The pattern in the examples shows that the _has_part of relation connects an object to one of its physical or conceptual components.
- For a drill (the tool), the "bit" is a well-known and essential part.

**Sorted candidate answers (if provided):**
1. bit (most likely, as per the extra fact)
2. chuck (also a part, but less central than bit)
3. motor (a part, but less directly associated than bit)
4. handle (a part, but less central than bit)
5. trigger (a part, but less central than bit)
6. battery (if cordless, a part, but less central than bit)

**Conclusion:**  
The most likely answer is **bit**. If you have a list of candidate answers, please provide them for a more detailed ranking.

The answer is ". The answer is aegean sea, so the [MASK] is aegean sea. ".
******
Understood. These related examples further reinforce that the "_has_part of" relation connects a whole to a significant or defining component or sub-part:

- tabooli _has_part of bulgur wheat (bulgur wheat is a main ingredient of tabooli)
- ocean liner _has_part of cabin (cabins are a key part of an ocean liner)
- thorax _has_part of sternum (the sternum is a part of the thorax)
- mediterranean sea _has_part of aegean sea (the Aegean Sea is a part of the Mediterranean Sea)

This pattern matches the previous reasoning: for (drill, _has_part of, [MASK]), the answer should be a key component of a drill.

Given all the examples and facts, the most likely answer remains **bit**. If you have candidate answers, please provide them for sorting.
******
Extra facts: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (drill, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of drill? The answer is ". The answer is drill, so the [MASK] is drill. ".
******
Thank you for the extra fact. This confirms that for the relation _derivationally_related_form of, the answer is "drill" itself. However, for the relation _has_part of, as shown in your previous facts and examples, the answer is "bit".

**Summary of likelihood for (drill, _has_part of, [MASK]):**
1. **bit** (most likely, as directly supported by your extra facts and consistent with the pattern in related examples)
2. Other drill parts (e.g., chuck, handle, motor) are possible but less likely than "bit" based on the provided evidence.

If you have a list of candidate answers, please provide them for a more detailed ranking. Otherwise, "bit" is the most likely answer.

Thank you for the related examples. To sort candidate answers for the question "what is the _hypernym of breadfruit tree? The answer is [MASK]", the following information is useful:

- A hypernym is a more general term for a given word (e.g., "animal" is a hypernym of "dog").
- In your examples, the hypernym is a broader category that the subject belongs to.
- For "breadfruit tree", we should look for a broader category that encompasses breadfruit trees.

Typical hypernyms for specific plant species or types of trees might be:
- "tree"
- "plant"
- "angiosperm"
- "fruit tree"
- "woody plant"

When you provide candidate answers, I will sort them by how likely they are to be the correct hypernym for "breadfruit tree", based on generality and fit with the examples provided. Please provide the candidate answers.

******
Understood. The extra fact indicates that "breadfruit tree" is a member of the "genus artocarpus." This means that a possible hypernym for "breadfruit tree" could be "genus artocarpus," but more generally, the hypernym should be a broader category such as "tree," "plant," or "fruit tree," depending on the level of generality.

When you provide candidate answers, I will use this information, along with the related examples, to sort them by their likelihood of being the correct hypernym for "breadfruit tree." Please provide the candidate answers.

Thank you for the additional related examples. Here’s a summary of what is useful for sorting candidate answers for the hypernym of "breadfruit tree":

- The hypernym is a broader, more general category that the subject belongs to.
- In the examples, the hypernym is often a category or class (e.g., "reptile genus" for "genus caretta", "youth subculture" for "hipsters").
- For "breadfruit tree", the hypernym should be a general class or category that includes breadfruit trees.

Given the facts and examples, likely hypernyms for "breadfruit tree" could be:
- "tree"
- "fruit tree"
- "plant"
- "angiosperm"
- "woody plant"
- "species"
- "artocarpus" (if using the genus as a hypernym, though this is less general than "tree" or "plant")

When you provide candidate answers, I will sort them by their likelihood of being the correct hypernym for "breadfruit tree" based on these patterns. Please provide the candidate answers.

Understood. Here’s what information is useful for sorting candidate answers:

1. **Derivationally Related Forms**: The relationship is between a word and another word derived from it, often by adding or removing affixes (e.g., noun to verb, verb to noun, etc.).
2. **Part of Speech**: The examples show that the derivationally related form can be a noun, verb, or gerund, depending on the base word.
3. **Semantic Connection**: The answer should be semantically connected to the base word, often representing an action, process, or result related to the base.
4. **Morphological Patterns**: Look for common derivational patterns (e.g., -ing, -ion, -ment, -ance, -al, etc.).
5. **Idiomatic Phrases**: For multi-word expressions like "take a breather," the derivationally related form may be a noun or verb that encapsulates the meaning of the phrase.

With these points in mind, I am ready to sort candidate answers for the given question. Please provide the candidate answers.

Understood. Here’s a summary of the most useful information for sorting candidate answers:

- **Derivationally Related Forms**: The answer should be a word or phrase that is morphologically or semantically derived from "take a breather."
- **Examples**: "ventilation" and "rest period" both have "take a breather" as their derivationally related form, suggesting that "take a breather" can be a derivational form of nouns related to rest or breathing.
- **Hypernym/Also See**: "pause" is a hypernym of "take a breather," and "rest" is related via "also see," but these are not derivationally related forms.
- **Directionality**: The derivationally related form can go from noun to verb phrase or vice versa.

Given these facts, when sorting candidate answers for the question "what is the _derivationally_related_form of take a breather? The answer is [MASK]," the most likely answers will be nouns or single words that encapsulate the meaning of "take a breather," such as "ventilation," "rest period," or similar.
