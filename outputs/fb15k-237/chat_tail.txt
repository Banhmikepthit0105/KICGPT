Thank you for providing the related examples. Here’s what is useful to consider for sorting candidate answers:

- The pattern in the examples is that the [MASK] is the language in which the film (or a film related to the original film) is made or spoken.
- The phrase "language of film of film of [Movie]" suggests a possible chain: the language of a film that is related to the original film (possibly a remake, sequel, or adaptation).
- In the examples, the answer is not always the primary language of the original film, but sometimes a language associated with a related film (e.g., "Quantum of Solace" → "Spanish Language", even though the original is in English).
- The answers are always specific languages (e.g., "Spanish Language", "French Language", "Yue Chinese", "English Language").

When sorting candidate answers, the following information is useful:
- The languages in which "RoboCop" or its related films (remakes, sequels, adaptations) have been made.
- Whether there is a notable related film of "RoboCop" in a language other than English.
- The most likely language associated with a "film of film of RoboCop" (possibly a remake of a remake, or an adaptation of an adaptation).

Please provide the candidate answers, and I will sort them by likelihood based on this reasoning.

Understood. Here’s a summary of what is useful from the extra facts:

- The pattern "film of film of" can refer to a remake, adaptation, or a related film in a chain, not just the original.
- The answer to [MASK] is always a specific entity (language, genre, medium, etc.) relevant to the chain of relationships.
- For "RoboCop, language of film of film of, [MASK]", the answer should be a language in which a related film (possibly a remake or adaptation of a remake) of RoboCop was made or released.
- The examples show that the answer is not always the most obvious or primary language, but can be a language of a less direct adaptation or remake.

Thank you for the additional related examples. Here’s what is most useful for sorting candidate answers:

- The [MASK] is always a language, formatted as "[Language] Language" (e.g., "English Language", "French Language").
- In most cases, the answer is "English Language", unless there is a notable remake or adaptation in another language (as in the "The Merry Widow" example, which is "French Language").
- The "film of film of" chain often leads to a remake or adaptation, sometimes in a different language, but often still in English unless there is a well-known non-English version.

Given this, for (RoboCop, language of film of film of, [MASK]), the most likely answer is "English Language", unless there is a prominent remake or adaptation in another language (such as "French Language" or "Spanish Language").

Understood. Here’s what might be useful for sorting candidate answers:

- The pattern in the related examples: Each city is associated with a specific month, likely representing the best or most notable month for travel based on climate.
- For European cities like Milan, the answer is July.
- For US cities like Boston, the answer is April; for Portland and Dallas, it is July.
- Zürich is a European city, similar to Milan.
- The most likely months for travel to Zürich, based on climate, are typically June, July, or August, but July is a strong candidate given the pattern for Milan.

When sorting candidate answers for the Zürich question, prioritize months that are summer months in Europe, especially July, as it matches the pattern for Milan.

Understood. Here’s how I would use the information to sort candidate answers for the Zürich question:

**Key points:**
- For the specific relation "month of travel_destination_monthly_climate of travel of climate of travel_destination of travel of Zürich", there are two possible answers in the extra facts: July and February.
- In the related examples, European cities like Milan have July as the answer.
- For Zürich, both July and February are given as correct answers in different contexts.

**Sorting logic:**
1. **July** — Most likely, as it matches the pattern for Milan (another European city) and is a common peak travel month for Zürich due to favorable summer weather.
2. **February** — Also possible, perhaps reflecting a popular winter travel season (e.g., for skiing), but less likely than July based on the pattern in the related examples.

**If candidate answers include July and February, sort as:**
1. July
2. February

**If other months are present, they are less likely than July or February for Zürich based on the provided facts and patterns.**

Thank you for the additional related examples. Here’s how I would now sort candidate answers for the Zürich question:

**Key observations:**
- European cities have a variety of "best" months: Milan (July), Vienna (November), Dublin (November), Frankfurt (May).
- Zürich has been given as July and February in the extra facts.
- There is no single month that is always the answer for European cities; it varies by city.

**Sorting candidate answers for Zürich:**

1. **July** — This is directly supported by the extra facts and matches the pattern for Milan (another central European city with a summer peak).
2. **February** — Also directly supported by the extra facts for Zürich, possibly reflecting a winter travel season.
3. **May** — Supported for Frankfurt, another German-speaking central European city, so it is plausible but less likely than July or February for Zürich.
4. **November** — Supported for Vienna and Dublin, but less likely for Zürich given the direct evidence for July and February.
5. **August** — Supported for Chicago, but not for any European city in the examples, so less likely.

**Sorted list of candidate answers for Zürich (most to least likely):**
1. July
2. February
3. May
4. November
5. August

Given all the related examples and extra facts, here is how I would sort candidate answers for the Zürich question ("what is the month of travel_destination_monthly_climate of travel of climate of travel_destination of travel of Zürich?"):

**Direct evidence from extra facts for Zürich:**
- July
- February
- November
- May

**Patterns from related European cities:**
- Milan: July
- Vienna: November
- Frankfurt: May
- Dublin: November

**Sorting logic:**
1. **Direct matches for Zürich** are most likely, and among those, months that are also common for other European cities are slightly more likely.
2. **Months not directly supported for Zürich** but supported for similar cities are less likely.

**Sorted candidate answers for Zürich (most to least likely):**
1. July (direct extra fact, matches Milan)
2. November (direct extra fact, matches Vienna and Dublin)
3. May (direct extra fact, matches Frankfurt)
4. February (direct extra fact, but less common in other examples)

- July is the answer for Madrid and Boston (summer, popular travel season).
- November is the answer for Vienna and Dublin.
- May is the answer for Frankfurt.
- January is the answer for Kiev and Helsinki (northern/winter destinations).

- July is strongly supported for European cities as a popular travel month, and is directly given for Zürich.
- November and May are also directly given for Zürich and are common for other European cities.
- February is directly given for Zürich but less common in other examples.
- January is not directly given for Zürich, so it is less likely.

Understood. Here’s what information might be useful before sorting candidate answers:

1. **Instrument/Role to Band Mapping:** The examples show a pattern where a musical instrument or role (e.g., Trumpet, Drums, Lead vocalist-GB, Sampler) is mapped to a band or group that is known for featuring that instrument or role in regular performances.

2. **Contextual Relevance:** The answer should be a musical group or band that is associated with the given instrument or role in a significant or regular way.

3. **Specificity:** The mapping is not generic (e.g., not just any band with a trumpet), but rather a band where the instrument/role is notably featured or associated.

4. **Pattern Recognition:** The structure of the question and answer is consistent: "what is the group of group_membership of music of regular_performances of performance_role of music of [Instrument/Role]? The answer is [Band]."

5. **Supplementary Facts:** Knowledge of which bands are associated with the Autoharp (the instrument in the current question) will be crucial. For example, The Incredible String Band is known for using the autoharp, as is The Carter Family.

Thank you for the extra facts. Here’s a summary of what is most useful for sorting candidate answers:

**Key Useful Information:**
- The pattern is to map an instrument (e.g., Autoharp) to a band/group that is known for regular performances featuring that instrument.
- In the specific example for Autoharp, the answer is "The Rolling Stones."
- Other instruments (Drums, Synthesizer) in the "role of group_membership..." context map to "Autoharp," but for the "group of group_membership..." context, the answer is a band.
- The mapping is not always the most obvious or traditional association (e.g., The Rolling Stones are not the most famous autoharp band, but they are given as the answer).

**How to Sort Candidate Answers:**
- Answers that are bands or groups should be ranked higher than those that are not.
- Among bands, those with any known association to the autoharp should be ranked higher.
- "The Rolling Stones" should be ranked highest, as it is given as the answer in the extra facts for this exact question.
- Other bands with some association to the autoharp (e.g., The Carter Family, The Incredible String Band) would follow.
- Bands with no known association to the autoharp would be ranked lower.
- Non-band answers (e.g., instruments, roles) would be ranked lowest.

Understood. Here’s how the related examples and extra facts inform the sorting of candidate answers for the question:

**Question:**  
"what is the group of group_membership of music of regular_performances of performance_role of music of Autoharp? The answer is [MASK]."

**Key Observations from Examples and Facts:**
- The answer is always a band or group, not an individual or an instrument.
- The mapping is not always the most obvious or traditional association, but rather a specific band that is linked in the dataset to the instrument.
- For Autoharp, the extra facts specify "The Rolling Stones" as the answer.
- Other instruments are mapped to bands that are known for featuring them, but not always exclusively or most famously.

**Sorting Criteria:**
1. **Highest Likelihood:** The band explicitly given in the extra facts for Autoharp ("The Rolling Stones").
2. **High Likelihood:** Bands with a known association to the autoharp (e.g., The Carter Family, The Incredible String Band).
3. **Medium Likelihood:** Bands that are generally known for featuring a variety of instruments, or are present in the related examples (e.g., Electric Light Orchestra, Asia, Tangerine Dream).
4. **Low Likelihood:** Bands with no known association to the autoharp.
5. **Lowest Likelihood:** Non-band answers (e.g., instruments, roles, individuals).

Thank you for the extra facts. Here’s how they further inform the sorting of candidate answers for the question:

**Question:**  
"what is the group of group_membership of music of regular_performances of performance_role of music of Autoharp? The answer is [MASK]."

**Key Insights from All Provided Facts and Examples:**

1. **Direct Mapping:**  
   - For the exact question with Autoharp, the answer is explicitly given as "The Rolling Stones" in your earlier extra facts.
   - This makes "The Rolling Stones" the most likely and correct answer.

2. **Pattern Consistency:**  
   - The mapping is from an instrument (Autoharp) to a band (The Rolling Stones), not to another instrument or a person.
   - Other examples (Guitar → Asia, Drums → Tangerine Dream, Cello → The Incredible String Band) reinforce that the answer should be a band.

3. **Supporting Associations:**  
   - Bill Wyman (a member of The Rolling Stones) is associated with the autoharp, which further supports the link between Autoharp and The Rolling Stones.

4. **Role vs. Group:**  
   - When the question is about the "role," the answer is an instrument (e.g., Flute, hurdy gurdy, Autoharp).
   - When the question is about the "group," the answer is a band.

Understood. Here’s what might be useful for sorting candidate answers:

- The pattern in the examples is: given a country or state, the answer is a city or town within that country or state, but not necessarily the capital or largest city.
- The phrase "contains of location of location of" suggests a location that is two steps removed: for example, a city within a region within the country.
- The answers in the examples (Zaragoza, Camden, Inverness, Decatur) are all cities or towns, not regions or countries.
- The answer is not the capital or most famous city, but a notable city within the given location.

Thank you for the extra facts. Here’s a summary of what is useful for sorting candidate answers:

- The [MASK] is typically a city, town, or county within England (e.g., St Albans, Kent, Winchester, Leicestershire).
- The answers are not always cities; sometimes they are counties (e.g., Kent, Leicestershire).
- The pattern "contains of location of location of" can refer to either a city/town or a county within England.
- The answers are not necessarily the most prominent or capital locations, but are notable subdivisions or settlements within England.

When sorting candidate answers, those that are cities, towns, or counties within England should be ranked higher. Answers that are not locations within England, or are at a higher administrative level (e.g., "United Kingdom"), should be ranked lower.

Please provide the candidate answers to be sorted.

Understood. Here’s a summary of the useful information for sorting candidate answers:

**Patterns from Examples:**
- The [MASK] is typically a location that is two administrative levels below the subject (e.g., city within a county, county within a country, institution within a town).
- The [MASK] can be a city, county, historical region, or even an institution, depending on the context.
- The [MASK] is always a real entity that is geographically or administratively contained within the subject, possibly via an intermediate location.

**For (England, contains of location of location of, [MASK]):**
- The most likely answers are cities, towns, or counties within England, or possibly notable institutions or historical regions if contextually appropriate.
- Answers that are not within England, or are at a higher administrative level than England, are less likely.
- The answer should not be a country or continent, but rather a subdivision or notable location within England.

**Sorting Criteria:**
1. Cities, towns, or counties within England (e.g., St Albans, Kent, Winchester, Leicestershire).
2. Notable institutions or historical regions within England (e.g., Eton College, if contextually appropriate).
3. Other locations within England.
4. Locations not within England or at a higher administrative level (least likely).

******
Understood. Here’s what is useful from these extra facts:

- The [MASK] can be a country (e.g., England) when the relationship is about nationality or country of location.
- For relationships like "nationality of person of people of" or "country of bibs_location of biblioness of base of," the answer is at the country level (e.g., England).
- For "contains of location of location of," the answer is typically a city, town, county, or notable institution within the given location, not the country itself.

**Summary for Sorting:**
- If the relationship is about nationality or country, the answer is likely a country (e.g., England).
- If the relationship is about "contains of location of location of," the answer is more likely a city, town, county, or institution within the given location, not the country itself.

This distinction helps in sorting candidate answers for the original question about England. Please provide the candidate answers to be sorted.

The final order:  
[Gloucestershire | Ilford | Maidstone | Windsor | West Berkshire | London Heathrow Airport | Cumbria | Swansea | Merthyr Tydfil | Dumfries and Galloway]

**Reasoning:**  
- Many examples show that the answer is often a city, town, borough, or notable institution within England.
- Gloucestershire, Ilford, Maidstone, Windsor, and West Berkshire are all locations within England and fit the pattern of previous answers (e.g., Colchester, York, Middlesex, London Borough of Tower Hamlets).
- London Heathrow Airport is a notable location in England, but as an airport, it is less likely than administrative or residential areas.
- Cumbria is a county in England, which is possible but less specific than the above.
- Swansea, Merthyr Tydfil, and Dumfries and Galloway are in Wales and Scotland, not England, making them least likely.

Understood. Here is what might be useful for sorting candidate answers:

1. **Pattern Recognition**: In each example, the answer is a film in which the given actor (e.g., Brad Dourif) appears, but not necessarily directly. The path "film of performance of film of film of actor of film of" suggests a multi-step relationship, likely traversing through films and actors in a chain.

2. **Entity Chains**: The chain seems to go:  
   Actor A → film(s) Actor A was in → other actor(s) in those films → film(s) those actors were in → other actor(s) in those films → film(s) those actors were in → ...  
   The answer is a film at the end of this chain.

3. **Examples**:  
   - Lois Smith → Minority Report  
   - John Rhys-Davies → The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring  
   - Rupert Everett → The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe  
   - John Cleese → Pinocchio  

4. **Supplementary Facts**:  
   - The answer is always a well-known film, often with ensemble casts.
   - The answer is not necessarily the most famous film of the actor, but one that fits the multi-step relationship.

5. **Sorting Criteria**:

   - The queries use a chain of relationships (e.g., "film of performance of film of film of actor of film of") to reach the answer.
   - The answer is not a direct property of the subject (e.g., Brad Dourif), but is reached by following a multi-step path through related entities.

2. **Entity Types:**  
   - For the "film of performance..." path, the answer is always a film.
   - For the "award_nominee of award_nomination..." path, the answer is always a person (an award nominee).

3. **Indirect Connections:**  
   - The answer is often not the most obvious or direct connection, but rather an entity reached by following the specified path through the knowledge graph.

4. **Examples Show:**  
   - The answer can be another actor who is connected via shared awards or nominations (e.g., Brad Dourif → Cate Blanchett).
   - The answer can be a film connected through a chain of actors and films (e.g., John Rhys-Davies → The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring).

**Sorting Criteria for Candidate Answers:**

- **Correct Entity Type:**  
  - For the "film of performance..." path, only films should be considered.
  - For the "award_nominee..." path

- The [MASK] is never a person or the award itself.
- The [MASK] is not a year or a general category, but a specific title.

**Examples:**
- For Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series, the [MASK] is "Upstairs, Downstairs" (a TV show).
- For BAFTA Award for Best Film, the [MASK] is "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" (a film).
- For MTV Movie Award for Best Scared-As-S**t Performance, the [MASK] is "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey" or "Inception" (films).

**Sorting Criteria:**
1. The most likely answers are specific works (films or TV shows) that were nominated for the award in question.
2. Answers that are not works (e.g., people, awards, years) are less likely.

**"What is the nominated_for of award_nomination of award of nominees of award_category of award of MTV Movie Award for Best Scared-As-S**t Performance? The answer is [MASK]."**

**Key Patterns from All Examples and Facts:**
- The [MASK] should be a film (e.g., "District 9", "House of Wax", "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey", "Inception").
- The [MASK] is not a person (e.g., "Jennifer Carpenter" is only the answer when the question is about award_winner, not nominated_for).
- The [MASK] is not the award name itself (e.g., "MTV Movie Award for Best Scared-As-S**t Performance" is only the answer when the subject is a person and the property is "award").
- The [MASK] is not a year or a general category.
- The [MASK] must be a specific work (film) that was nominated for the MTV Movie Award for Best Scared-As-S**t Performance.

The final order:  
Twilight | Black Swan | The Help | Sherlock Holmes | Batman Begins | The Avengers | Iron Man 2 | Iron Man | 2012 | Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl

**Reasoning:**  
- "Twilight" and "Black Swan" are both well-known for being nominated for (and in the case of "Twilight," winning) the MTV Movie Award for Best Scared-As-S**t Performance.
- "The Help" is less likely but possible, as it is a drama with some intense moments, though not typically associated with this category.
- "Sherlock Holmes" and "Batman Begins" have suspenseful elements but are not primarily horror/thriller films.
- "The Avengers," "Iron Man 2," "Iron Man," and "2012" are action/disaster films and less likely to be nominated for a "scared-as-s**t" performance.
- "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" is an adventure/fantasy film and the least likely among the list for this specific award category.

Thank you for providing the related examples. Here’s what is useful to note for sorting candidate answers:

**Key Information from Examples:**
- The pattern is: [Government Position], jurisdiction_of_office ... [MASK]
- The [MASK] is the jurisdiction (country, state, city, etc.) over which the office has authority.
- For "President," the answer is a country (Chad).
- For "Mayor," the answer is a city (Culver City).
- For "Lieutenant Governor," the answer is a state (Vermont).
- For "Secretary of state," the answer is a state (Arkansas).

**Implication for the Goal Question:**
- The position is "Prime minister-GB."
- "GB" stands for Great Britain (or more accurately, the United Kingdom in political context).
- The jurisdiction_of_office for "Prime minister-GB" would be the country over which the Prime Minister of Great Britain has authority.

**What to Look for in Candidate Answers:**
- The most likely answer is a country, specifically the United Kingdom (or Great Britain, depending on the context).
- Less likely answers would be cities, states, or unrelated countries.
- The answer should match the level of jurisdiction appropriate for a Prime Minister (national, not local or regional).

**How to Sort:**
1. United Kingdom (or Great Britain, if that's the label used)
2. Other countries (less likely, but possible if there's confusion

Thank you for the extra facts. Here’s how they affect the sorting:

**Analysis of Extra Facts:**
- The new examples show that for (Prime minister-GB, ...), the [MASK] can be various countries (Madagascar, Kenya, Spain, Tonga), not just the United Kingdom or Great Britain.
- This suggests that in the data or context you are working with, "Prime minister-GB" is being associated with the jurisdiction of the office of Prime Minister in multiple countries, not just the UK.
- Therefore, the most likely answers for [MASK] are country names, and specifically, countries that have a Prime Minister as a government position.

**Updated Sorting Criteria:**
1. Country names (especially those known to have a Prime Minister)
2. Other types of jurisdictions (states, cities) are much less likely
3. Non-jurisdictional or unrelated entities are least likely

**Summary:**
- The most likely answers are country names, not limited to the United Kingdom, but any country with a Prime Minister.
- The least likely answers are cities, states, or non-jurisdictional entities.

Please provide the candidate answers to sort.

Understood. Here’s a summary of the sorting logic based on all the provided examples and facts:

**Key Patterns:**
- For positions like "Prime minister-GB," "Member of Parliament-GB," "Premier," and "State Senator," the [MASK] is the jurisdiction where that office exists.
- For "Prime minister-GB," the [MASK] is always a country (Poland, Madagascar, Kenya, Spain, Tonga).
- For "Member of Parliament-GB," the [MASK] is a country (Ghana).
- For "Premier," the [MASK] is a province (Québec).
- For "State Senator," the [MASK] is a state (California).

**Sorting Criteria:**
1. **Most Likely:** Country names (especially those with a Prime Minister, for "Prime minister-GB")
2. **Next Likely:** Subnational jurisdictions (provinces, states) if the position is appropriate (e.g., "Premier" or "State Senator")
3. **Least Likely:** Cities, non-jurisdictional entities, or unrelated terms

**For the goal question:**
- The most likely [MASK] for "Prime minister-GB" is a country.
- The country does not have to be the UK; it can be any country with a Prime Minister, as shown in the examples.

The final order:  
Ghana | Cyprus | Sierra Leone | Suriname | Indonesia | Sudan | Saudi Arabia | North Korea | San Marino | Liechtenstein

**Rationale:**  
- **Ghana, Cyprus, Sierra Leone, Suriname, Indonesia**: All have or have had the position of Prime Minister, making them the most likely.
- **Sudan, Saudi Arabia, North Korea**: These countries have had similar positions or heads of government, but the title "Prime Minister" may not be current or primary.
- **San Marino, Liechtenstein**: These are microstates with different governmental structures (e.g., Captains Regent in San Marino, and Liechtenstein is a principality with a head of government called the Prime Minister, but it's less commonly referred to as such in English), making them least likely in this context.
