Understood. I will analyze all provided examples (both analogies and supplementary information) to determine the most probable language for *RoboCop*. The key observations are:

1. **Pattern from Analogies**:  
   - Films like *Quantum of Solace* (Spanish), *The Last of the Mohicans* (French), and *Rush Hour* (Yue Chinese) show that a film's language isn't always English, but often tied to its setting/production.  
   - However, most examples (*Raging Bull*, *Barney's Version*, *Gods and Monsters*, *Invictus*) default to English unless context suggests otherwise.  

2. **Supplementary Context for *RoboCop***:  
   - Distributed by **Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer** and **Orion Pictures** (major U.S. studios).  
   - Stars **Kurtwood Smith** (American actor).  
   - Genres include **Science Fiction** and **Superhero movie** (typically English-dominated).  
   - No explicit multilingual context (unlike *Quantum of Solace*'s Spanish setting).  

**Conclusion**: The most probable language is **English**, given the U.S. production/distribution, cast, and genre norms.

******
Understood. I will incorporate these new analogy examples into my analysis while maintaining silence. The key takeaways are:

1. **English as Default**: Most American-produced films (*WarGames*, *It's Complicated*) default to English unless context suggests otherwise.
2. **Exceptions Exist**: Films like *The Hurt Locker* (Turkish) and *Apocalypse Now* (French) show language can vary based on setting/theme, even for U.S. films.
3. **RoboCop Context**: 
   - No evidence of non-English setting (unlike *Apocalypse Now*'s Vietnam/French connection).
   - Strong ties to U.S. production (MGM/Orion, American cast).

**Conclusion**: English remains the most probable answer, but I'll verify if candidate answers suggest otherwise.

Understood. I will analyze this additional supplementary information about *RoboCop* while maintaining silence. The key insights are:

1. **Production Context**: 
   - Confirmed production by **Orion Pictures** (major American studio)
   - Nominated for **Academy Awards** (Best Sound Mixing) and **BAFTA** (Makeup & Hair) - prestigious English-language awards

2. **Cultural Context**:
   - No indication of multilingual production (unlike *The Hurt Locker*'s Turkish or *Apocalypse Now*'s French)
   - Awards recognition suggests mainstream Hollywood/English-language film

3. **Consistency with Previous Patterns**:
   - American studio + American awards = high probability of English as primary language
   - No contradictory evidence found in any examples

**Final Assessment**: All evidence consistently points to English as the most probable language for *RoboCop*.

Understood. Based on the examples, I notice that:  

1. **For the month of travel_destination_monthly_climate**, the answers vary by city (e.g., Boston = April, Milan/Portland/Dallas = July).  
2. **For Zürich specifically**, two conflicting answers appear: **July** and **February**.  
3. The supplementary examples (mode_of_transportation, contains) don’t directly help with the month prediction but confirm Zürich as a valid entity.  

**Key Observations for Sorting:**  
- If the task is to predict the **most likely month** for Zürich’s travel climate, **July** appears more frequently in analogous cities (Milan, Portland, Dallas).  
- **February** is also a possible answer for Zürich, but less aligned with the trend in other cities.  

When you provide the candidate answers, I will prioritize **July** over **February** unless other evidence suggests otherwise. Ready for the candidates.

Understood. Based on the expanded examples, I observe:  

1. **Patterns in Analogous Cities:**  
   - **Summer Months (July/August):** Milan, Portland, Dallas, Chicago.  
   - **Late Autumn (November):** Dublin, Vienna.  
   - **Spring (May):** Frankfurt.  
   - **Winter (February):** Zürich (conflicting).  

2. **For Zürich:**  
   - Previously, **July** (summer) and **February** (winter) were given as answers.  
   - **July aligns with summer trends** (like Milan, Dallas).  
   - **February is an outlier** but plausible for winter travel (e.g., skiing).  

3. **Geographical Context:**  
   - Zürich is a Central European city (like Vienna, Frankfurt).  
   - Vienna’s answer is **November**, but Frankfurt’s is **May**—no clear regional trend.  

**Sorting Strategy:**  
- If candidates include **July**, prioritize it (matches summer trend).  
- **February** is secondary (valid but less common in examples).  
- Other months (e.g., May, November) would rank lower unless context supports them.

Understood. Here’s the refined analysis based on all provided examples:  

### **Key Observations for Zürich's Travel Month Prediction**  
1. **Conflicting Answers for Zürich:**  
   - **July** (earlier example, aligns with summer destinations like Milan/Dallas).  
   - **February** (earlier example, outlier for winter).  
   - **November** (new example, matches Dublin/Vienna’s late autumn trend).  
   - **May** (new example, matches Frankfurt’s spring trend).  

2. **Geographical & Seasonal Trends:**  
   - **Summer (July/August):** Common for warm-weather travel (Milan, Dallas, Chicago).  
   - **Spring (May):** Frankfurt (similar Central European city).  
   - **Late Autumn (November):** Dublin, Vienna (colder, cultural travel).  
   - **Winter (February):** Only Zürich, possibly ski tourism.  

3. **Most Likely Interpretation:**  
   - The **"travel_destination_monthly_climate"** likely refers to the **peak travel month** based on ideal weather or tourism trends.  
   - Zürich’s answers now span **May, July, November, February**, suggesting **seasonal variability** (e.g., spring sightseeing, summer festivals, winter sports).

### **Key Insights for Zürich's Travel Month Prediction**  
1. **Expanded Analogous Examples:**  
   - **Summer (July):** Madrid, Boston, Milan, Portland, Dallas (consistent for warm-weather destinations).  
   - **Winter (January/February):** Kiev, Helsinki (cold climates), Zürich’s **February** aligns here.  
   - **Spring (May):** Frankfurt, Zürich’s **May**.  
   - **Late Autumn (November):** Dublin, Vienna, Zürich’s **November**.  

2. **Zürich-Specific Answers:**  
   - **July** (summer tourism, aligns with Madrid/Boston).  
   - **February** (winter sports, aligns with Kiev/Helsinki).  
   - **May** (spring, aligns with Frankfurt).  
   - **November** (late autumn, aligns with Dublin/Vienna).  

3. **Geographical Context:**  
   - Zürich shares traits with:  
     - **Frankfurt/Vienna (Central Europe):** May/November.
